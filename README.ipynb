    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Healthcare is probably one of the most discussed topics around, with places like the UK having their free healthcare and others having a well developed private healthcare system like the US and Australia. In this project we will be looking to identify the top 5 companies where majority have the least amount of access to healthcare support/doctors.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "By identifying this list will allow us to better understand what countries would benefit from receiving external support. However, we don't want to just stop there, Doctors, just like the rest of us need to get paid, so how does the amount invested into the healthcare system (both public and private) affects a countries ranking position.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To expand on this we will also be looking at life expectancy from two different point of views. One point will be is that, naturally most of us would assume that countries that have the least amount of doctors will have the lower life expectancy, creating a graph with a negative correlation, but what does the data show. Could it be that the countries with the least amount of doctors and relying on other forms of healthcare or alternative medicine giving them a longer life.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Lastly we will also be looking at how it is affected by the amount of money that has been invested into the healthcare system. Once again most of us naturally would assume that the countries that have invested less into their healthcare have the lower life expectancy for their population, creating a graph with a negative correlation. However, what does the data show, as they may be countries that invested heavily into their healthcare system to improve and develop it but still have a low life expectancy."

    "<br>\n",
    "To identify the Top 10 countries we will be talking the population and number of doctors per 1000 data found on gapminder to identify the countries that have the least amount of doctors. The population of the countries must be considered to ensure a fair comparison is made. For example if both Country A and B have 10,000 doctors but A has a population 1 million and B has 4 million. Which means from first impressions you would have thought, they were the same but when you bring population into the equation we can see that country B would higher in the ranking for least accessible healthcare system.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In order to do this, I will be calculating the taking the average number of doctors for each country, to accomdate for any missing data from across the years. The missing date could be due to a number of things such as, the governments not having the resources or not having the money to consistently collect the data or many other reasons. To ensure that data wasn't simply dropped and missing out on countries that could potentially be at the top of the list an average will be calculated. Where there is only 1 data point, the assumption will be made that the number has stayed constant.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "When looking into the money invested into healthcare we looking at the amount of money the government has on average spent per a person. We will be taking that data and multiplying it by the population and then calculating the mean in order to understand how much each country has invested into their healthcare industry over the last 10 years. This will be plotted against "

Now this is still as they could be other factors involved for example the education system not being developed enough.\n",

    "When comparing the average life expectancy to the lowest amount of doctors we can see that the list has changed up. With 3 new location popping up; Eritrea, China and Brazil. This raises an interesting question as all 3 where found in the Top 10 highest healthcare contribution by the government as you can see from the list below. As a recommendation I would suggest to look further into why this could potentially be the case.\n",
