# Identifing the Top 5 Countries globally that have the least Healthcare access

Doctors Go Anywhere are looking to expand their outreach after their recent funding. In order to understand where their services would be the most valuable, they would like to identify the Top 5 regions that have the lowest access to healthcare.

The objective of this project, alongside identifing the above, we will also be looking into the following states:
1) Investigate how the money invested into healthcare affects a countries position in the rankings
2) Investigate how the life expectancy correlates with the money invested into healthcare

# Executive Summary

Healthcare is probably one of the most discussed topics around, with places like the UK having their free healthcare and others having a well developed private healthcare system like the US and Australia. In this project we will be looking to identify the top 5 companies where majority have the least amount of access to healthcare support/doctors.

By identifying this list will allow us to better understand what countries would benefit from receiving external support. However, we don't want to just stop there, Doctors, just like the rest of us need to get paid, so how does the amount invested into the healthcare system (both public and private) affects a countries ranking position.

To expand on this we will also be looking at life expectancy from two different point of views. One point will be is that, naturally most of us would assume that countries that have the least amount of doctors will have the lower life expectancy, creating a graph with a negative correlation, but what does the data show. Could it be that the countries with the least amount of doctors and relying on other forms of healthcare or alternative medicine giving them a longer life.

Lastly we will also be looking at how it is affected by the amount of money that has been invested into the healthcare system. Once again most of us naturally would assume that the countries that have invested less into their healthcare have the lower life expectancy for their population, creating a graph with a negative correlation. However, what does the data show, as they may be countries that invested heavily into their healthcare system to improve and develop it but still have a low life expectancy.

# Methodology

To identify the Top 10 countries we will be talking the population and number of doctors per 1000 data found on gapminder to identify the countries that have the least amount of doctors. The population of the countries must be considered to ensure a fair comparison is made. For example if both Country A and B have 10,000 doctors but A has a population 1 million and B has 4 million. Which means from first impressions you would have thought, they were the same but when you bring population into the equation we can see that country B would higher in the ranking for least accessible healthcare system.
